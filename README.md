# Root Certificate Updater
Update root certificates (and disallowed certificates) on Windows.

This repo contains **two options** to update root certificates. **Each option performs the same procedure.** 

If you're not sure which option to choose, use the GUI (the first option) as it's the easiest.

**No changes are made to any settings**, this **only** updates the root certificates.
